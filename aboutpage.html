                    <p>Hello there, my name is Nurin N and I am currently a Year 2 student in 
                        Experience and Communication Design of class 2020/2021.I live in the 
                        east area of Singapore.
                        When I am not busy with my projects, I would spend time enjoying music and playing
                        the guitar/ukelele or baking during my free time.

                    </p>
                    <p>I chose thing module as I thought that it was more interesting to be able
                        to get to create our own product as well as learning new skills and knowledge that
                        I may not know previously.I hope to gain more understanding while learning how to make
                        something through the things that I have not experience before such as 3d/laser printing
                        and prototyping through the use of coding.I look forward to the future lessons that we have
                        in this module and the outcome of my product later on.
                    </p>
