                    <h2>Introduction to Fusion 360</h2>
                    <p>In this week, we were introduced to a programme whereby one can create their own digital model of something that they
                        would like to create for printing later on.I found it quite interesting to use such a programme that I was not that familiar with.
                        The programme was relatively easy to work with only with a few features that I was abit confused about.However, after a few tries,
                        I managed to get a hang of it.
                    </p>

                    <p>We were assigned to familirise with the programme through doing a few sketching exercise to see how it would
                        look like.For the first exercise, we had to sketch out a clock like shape.We were also given a video tutorial
                    to refer to which I found quite useful.The diagram mostly contained simple shapes to form the picture and can be
                done with rectangles and circles.We were taught about how to dimension it to set the lenght needed and how we could
            use the trim tool to cut out any unneccesary lines.This was my take on the sketch: </p>

                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <img src= "exercise 1 sketch.jpeg" height="200" width="350" />
                            </td>
                        </tr>

                    <p>For exercise number two, it was slight harder as it contained complex shapes such as the polygon instead
                        of a circle in the middle.The gap in between the cicle and the connecting body was also abit confusing to 
                    achieve, however after a few trial and errors, I also manage to get it.This exercise contained more of how one
                could use lines and shapes to connect the sketch when needed instead of just the regular shapes.This was my
            take on the sketch. </p>
