                    <h2>3D Printing</h2>
                    <p>In this assignment, we had to learn how to print our own 3d model of a knight chess piece.
                        This was where we also could find out more about how the revolve and extrude feature would 
                        work in a project.We first had to find and image to trace the model over as our sketch.</p>

                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <img src= "phone " height="450" width="450" />
                            </td>
                        </tr>

                    <p>After sketching, I proceeded to do up the model.The base was achieve through using the revolve tool while the horse itself was done through extruding.I then had to export the file as an stl format in order to bring it over to cura to further customise on how I wanted the piece to be printed out. </p>

                    <p>At cura, we had to set up 3 different setting and finalise the best one for printing.I experimented with the infill, wall thickness and supports.I notice that the spacing between the horse head and it's body had a gap, so I thought that it was the best to add in supports to ensure that it was sturdy and would not fall off easily after printing. </p>
                       
                       <tr>
                        <td><img src="" height="450" width="450" />
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <p> </p>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="" height="300" width="450" />
                        </td>
                    </tr>

                    <p> As it was printing out, I realised that a skirt would have been a better option as the current one I had made it stick to the bottom of the printer, something I could consider when doing any future projects.The model was also abit too small than expected but it took at least 30 minutes to print it.I suspected that it was because of the infill that I had set to 15% which took most of the timing filling the inside. </p>

                        <tr>
                            <td><img src="" height="300" width="450" />
                            </td>
                        </tr>

                        <p>This was my finished result of my 3D printing  </p>
