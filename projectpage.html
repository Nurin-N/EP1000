                    <h2>Starry Mood Lamp</h2>
                    <p> For this CA project, I intend to create and build my own mood lamp which is 
                        of a starry/space themed.I firstly went ahead to look for references of how people
                        have made their own mood lamp on instructables and got my inspiration from there.
                         </p>

                    <p>Then, i proceeded to think about what kind of features I would want to add on.
                        I thought about add a touch sensor feature whereby, one could simply tap on the Lamp
                        to either change the colours of the light or to switch on and off whenever needed.
                        This would mean that the design would not have any buttons to make it look more seamless.
                        I also thought about have star shapes carved on the top part in order to have some type of
                        shape and space for light to go through and project the shape onto the ceiling when one uses it.
                    </p>

                    <p>I went ahead and did some sketches on how I wanted it to look like.I have 2 designs in mind, one being
                        the mood lamp to be a vertical cuboid shapes and then have the top part with that stars design.Another
                        having the mood lamp to be a pyramid shape and having the start design being carved on one of the sides.
                    </p>

                        </td>
                    </tr>   
                    
                    <p>Additionaly, I proceeded to research more about what kind of tools/items are needed
                        to create a mood lamp </p>
