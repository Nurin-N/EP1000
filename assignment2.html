                    <h2>Jake Wright's Website Exercise</h2>
                    <p>We were tasked to create our own website for this elective module.However, we first had to start
                        by using a template to follow first in order to get the basics down.A video tutorial on following
                        Jake Wright's template was given for us to watch and follow on how he executes it.
                    </p>

                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <img src= "" height="200" width="350" />
                            </td>
                        </tr>

                    <p>In the video, he starts on explaining the different pages and elements he would like on his website.
                        He then goes on to divide it into the body, the different divs, headlines etc. </p>

                    <p>He also adds on the things placed within the different divs such as the nav and main, the 
                        content, the sizing for the different headers and the copyright symbol. </p>
                       
                       <tr>
                        <td><img src="code1.jpeg" height="200" width="350" />
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <p> </p>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="code2.jpeg" height="200" width="350" />
                        </td>
                    </tr>

                    <p>However, this meant only a plain text without any style in it.Hence, he added in
                        a stylesheet through css that he would personalise later on using the link relationship.
                        This was my take on his website:
            
                    </p>

                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="css.jpeg" height="200" width="350" />
                        </td>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="css2.jpeg" height="200" width="350" />
                        </td>
                    </tr>

                        <tr>
                            <td><img src="jwwebsite.jpeg" height="200" width="350" />
                            </td>
                        </tr>

                        <p>I then used his template to personalised my own website for this module by
                            changing the size, colours, fonts and adding pictures to it.This website is a documentation
                            of how I changed his template to be my owm. </p>

                            <tr>
                                <td><img src="mw.jpeg" height="200" width="350" />
                                </td>
                            </tr>
