                    <h2>Phone Stand Prototype</h2>
                    <p>For this week, we were assigned to come up with ideas on making a personal
                        phone stand.We were firstly given instructions on how we could go about starting on the project itself.
                        We were shown the process of creating ideas followed by developing them through sketches and then applying
                        and making a cardboard prototype about it.</p>

                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <img src= "phone front view sketch.jpeg" height="450" width="450" />
                            </td>
                        </tr>

                    <p>With this, I started out my project by brainstorming potential designs for my phone stand on paper.
                        Then, I sketch out a rough plan on how it would look like and specified the specific features for the stand.
                        This included things such as where and how I wanted my phone to be, Should I include any support for it to stand 
                        and if I wanted to add any additional items.</p>

                    <p>Next, I went ahead and did a second draft of my prototype, with a clearer image in mind.I also included the measurements for the phone
                        stand to fit nicely, not forgetting to add a few more cm allowances for the phone.I went ahead to
                       start out on my prototype using cardboard. </p>
                       
                       <tr>
                        <td><img src="phone side view sketch.jpeg" height="450" width="450" />
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <p> </p>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="phone stand front view.jpeg" height="300" width="450" />
                        </td>
                    </tr>

                    <p>However, I realised that I did not have enough cardboard for the sides of the stand and hence
                        had to substitute it using some tape so that I could form the rest of the support structure and prevent the phone
                        from toppling over.The outcome of it was generally successful, being able to hold my phone
                        and having a place to store my headphone wire.Some thing that could be improved on would be the size of the stand as it could have been
                        a little more smaller in size so that it would be more convienient to carry around.</p>

                        <tr>
                            <td><img src="phone stand side view.jpeg" height="300" width="450" />
                            </td>
                        </tr>
