                    <h2>Laser printing</h2>
                    <p>This week we explored more about laser cutting.However, we firstly had to create a model 
                        to laser cut using Fusion 360.We were assigned to do up a box to make it into a music box. </p>

                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                <img src= "phone front view sketch.jpeg" height="450" width="450" />
                            </td>
                        </tr>

                    <p>We started sketching it out first.I learnt about a new feature called change parameters.
                        This allows one to have fixed dimension for certain things, could be length, width and 
                        height etc.This can be applied when doing your sketch, where one can simply type in what 
                        is needed and need not type the number.</p>

                    <p> We also learnt had to add in tabs into the box so that the sides could fit in nicely and stand.
                        I had encounter problems doing it as I forgot to consider the base of the box and left no tabs 
                        there in the beginning.After realising the mistake, I redrew certainly parts of sketch and could 
                        achieve the results wanted   </p>
                       
                       <tr>
                        <td><img src="" height="450" width="450" />
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <p> </p>
                    <tr>
                        <td><img src="" height="300" width="450" />
                        </td>
                    </tr>

                    <p> This was my box model on Fusion 360 </p>

                        <tr>
                            <td><img src="" height="300" width="450" />
                            </td>
                        </tr>
