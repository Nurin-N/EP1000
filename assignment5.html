                    <h2>Creating model in Fusion 360</h2>
                    <p>For this, we were tasked to explore more functions and features that were available on Fusion 360
                        so that we were able to start making our own creations and print them soon.
                    </p>

                    <p>Firstly,we had to design our own name tag with specific measurement that was provided on the instruction page.
                        I found this assignment to be generally okay for me as I was already familiar with the sketching process.
                    As for turning it into a model, I had to refer to the video tutorial provided and learn about extruding which is the method
                of controlling the thickness of the model and how much would one would like to bring up. </p>

                <tr>
                    <td><img src="keychain sketch.jpeg" height="200" width="350" />
                    </td>
                </tr>
                    <p>For my name tag, I made it into the rectangular shape with rounded sides.I made the base slightly thinner while
                        the sides abit thicker to show the contrast of when I extrude my name and create that "3D effect".I faced abit of
                    difficulty doing this as I soon realised I had placed the name layer below the base, hence it was covering the name.
                I then manage to get it after a few minutes,This was the results.  </p>
                       
                       <tr>
                        <td><img src="keychain.jpeg" height="200" width="350" />
                        </td>
                    </tr>
